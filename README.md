# Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction — Logistic Regression

This learning project analyzes the Cardiovascular Study Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christofel04/cardiovascular-study-dataset-predict-heart-disea) to predict a patient’s 10-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD).  
It uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing (missing values, outliers, categorical encoding), and a Logistic Regression model to classify risk.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Understand the dataset and medical risk factors for CHD.
- Handle missing values using median (numeric) and frequency (categorical) imputation.
- Encode categorical variables for modeling.
- Detect and analyze outliers using Z-score > 3.
- Train and evaluate a Logistic Regression classifier.
- Visualize relationships between features and the target variable.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christofel04/cardiovascular-study-dataset-predict-heart-disea) contains  health metrics and demographics such as:
- Age, gender, BMI, blood pressure.
- Smoking status, diabetes history, stroke history.
- 10-year CHD risk (binary target).

Some categorical variables are unbalanced (e.g., diabetes, stroke). Missing values were handled to preserve sample size.
